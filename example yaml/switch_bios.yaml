# To enable parallel update in nvfwupd, set the ParallelUpdate key to true
ParallelUpdate: true

# When ParallelUpdate is enabled, "Targets" becomes a list of systems alongside their packages
# BMC_IP, RF_USERNAME, RF_PASSWORD, PACKAGE are mandatory when using parallel update
# TARGET_PLATFORM would be needed for any systems that would normally require it from the command line (i.e: GB200, gb200switch, etc.)
# UPDATE_PARAMETERS_TARGETS is optional, but uses the same exact params as the special target file for nvfwupd "-s" option in json format with a given system
# SYSTEM_NAME is an entirely optional, but recommended user defined string. It is used to more easily distinguish systems as it is used in task printouts
